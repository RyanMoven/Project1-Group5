### Project Description:

The proposed outcome of this project is a Road Trip Assistant that captures the user's input to determine point A and point B of a Road Trip.  The application will use an API to display the data for the road trip, such as a map, distance to be driven, time that it will take to complete the road trip, and of course the directions.
The application will use another API to retrieve weather conditions of the destination and use this information to display current weather for the destination.  This information will also be used to display recommendations for what to pack or bring for the road trip.

### APIs To Be Used:

- Google Maps APIs (Might encompass multiple ones)
- Wunderground API
